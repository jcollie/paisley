Implements the CouchDB API for twisted.

## Release Notes v0.3

_Enhancements_

* Added support for CouchDB 1.1.0.
* Added test cases against real CouchDB instance.
* Upgraded client interface to reflect CouchDB API changes (count -> limit). The changes occurred in CouchDB 0.8 -> 0.9.
* Tests will run even if the admin party is closed in the system-wide couchdb configuration
* Added CouchDB authentication support (supply username and password args when instantiating)
* Re-factored underlying HTTP transport to use Twisted Web Agent (will allow connection pooling in the future).
* Re-factored code into formal Python package. API compatible with old package layout.

_Bug Fixes_
* Fixed attachment handling so it returns the attachment instead of the owning document (dwb)

## Release Notes (0.1->0.2)

* Updated CouchDB support up to version CouchDB 1.0.1


## Known issues

* Doesn't keep connections alive between requests.

## Notes

This isn't under heavy maintenance by me, I only use a subset of the functionality and wrap the rest away in a non-portable internal library.  Please fork and make it better.
